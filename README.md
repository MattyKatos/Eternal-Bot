   ```
   
   Edit `.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

   DB_PATH=./data/eternal_bot.db
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   ```

3. **Get your FC ID**:
   - Visit your FC page on Lodestone: `https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/freecompany/YOUR_FC_ID/member/`
   - Copy the number from the URL (e.g., `9231394073691181144`)

   - Right-click your username and select "Copy User ID"

5. **Deploy slash commands**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy-commands.js
   ```

6. **Start the bot**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or for development with auto-restart:
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Use `/ebadmin` for scraping, viewing members, and editing profiles.
2. **User Profile**: Users run `/eb` to see their profile and claim Daily Firebrands.
   - If unlinked, users are prompted to ping `<@&1313525202239619103>` to get linked.
3. **Deathroll**: Start a game with `/ebdeathroll <bet>`, accept with the button, and take turns rolling.
4. **Regular Sync**: The sync service runs automatically every 30 minutes and can be triggered from `/ebadmin`.

## Permission System

- **Global Admin**: User specified in `GMDISCID` has full access to admin dashboard actions
- **Database Admins**: FC members with `user_level = 'admin'` can use admin dashboard actions
- **Regular Users**: Can use `/eb` and `/ebdeathroll`
- **Self-Service**: Users can unlink themselves; only admins can link users

## Permissions

- **Admin Actions**: Global admin (`GMDISCID`) and database admins (`user_level: 'admin'`) can use admin actions in `/ebadmin`
- **General Commands**: All server members can use `/eb` and `/ebdeathroll`
- **Self-Service**: Users can unlink their own characters. Linking is admin-only.

## Troubleshooting

- **Commands not appearing**: Run the deploy script and wait a few minutes
- **Permission errors**: Verify `GMDISCID` matches your Discord user ID exactly
- **Scraping issues**: Check if Lodestone structure has changed or if rate limiting is occurring
- **Database errors**: Ensure the `data/` directory is writable
